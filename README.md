## Introduction

To get started install requirements (and create a virtual environment if you want):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, you may proceed with running notebooks in `notebooks` directory. There are two notebooks: `01-initial-data-exploration.ipynb` and `02-sar.ipynb`. The first one contains initial data exploration and the second one contains implementation of the model.

For the benchmark part, you can run `evaluate.py` script in `benchmark` directory. It will evaluate the model on the test dataset.

Final report of the project is located in `reports` directory.
